                <p>
                    Before starting my business, Organizing with Annie, I worked in various positions in housing, higher education, and counseling for nonprofits.  Most recently I have worked as an advocate and counselor for women, children and families experiencing violence.  Combining my skills as a counselor, a supervisor, and an advocate I have launched Organizing with Annie to create collaborative partnerships with my clients to help them find the best versions of their spaces and themselves.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have built my business, Organizing with Annie, on the belief that everyone and everything deserves a home.  Whether you’re in an apartment you rent, or house you own, your living space should be safe, comfortable, and functional.  I’m a big believer in self-care and have learned through many different aspects of my career that we all, women especially, tend to care for everyone else first and never have time for ourselves.  I want to help make your home more organized so you will spend less time looking for things and have more time to treat yourself.  As a member of the New England chapter of the National Association of Professional Organizers (NAPO) I am continually building my skills and increasing my knowledge of the best products and resources to assist my clients in achieving the outcomes they want.     After a brief consultation I can take your concerns, challenges, and dreams for your spaces and provide you with systems that will work best for you.  It is a privilege and an honor to be invited into someone’s home to be part of making their spaces more comfortable for their family, their business, and their guests.

                        Whether your garage never has room for your car, or your basement has piles so high you can’t walk through it, Organizing with Annie is the right choice for you.  I can help transform your garage into a neat and tidy room just for your cars.  If you struggle every year to find your warm sweaters when the temperature drops or you need your bathing suits as soon as the sun starts to shine I can help design a system that makes looking for off season items a breeze so you can spend more time bundled up by the fire or stretched out in the sand.

I have several years of experience organizing a wide range of moves from small moves down the street to large moves across the country.  My tips and tricks for making your next move a smooth and enjoyable experience will reduce stress and lower costs, as I work one on one with you ensuring that your belongings, no matter how large or small, make it safely from one location to the next.  Moving should be about the excitement of the new place, it shouldn’t be something you dread or feel anxious about.  I want to make your next move worry free and something to look forward to.

                        Going away to college is can be an exciting and anxious time for both the student and the rest of their family.  With more than 5 years experience working in housing, on university campuses, I know just what each student needs and how to fit everything into their new, compact residence hall room.  I can also share ideas for a smooth transition when the student comes back to their childhood home to visit during school breaks.
